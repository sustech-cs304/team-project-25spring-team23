# Racing in SUSTech

## Functional Requirements

1. Friendly User Interface

   Start/quit the game , enter a level and navigate menus conveniently. Get clear guidance(e.g. keyboard guidance/mission guidance) from HUD and minimap.

2. Realistic Vehicle Entry & Exit Animation

   Players can seamlessly enter and exit the vehicle with smooth animations.

3. Advanced Driving Physics (Acceleration, Braking, and Drifting)

   Vehicles respond realistically to acceleration and braking, considering speed, weight, and terrain and on-screen indicators should provide clear feedback.
   Drifting mechanics allow controlled oversteering, with tire friction and road conditions affecting performance.

## Unfunctional Requirements

1. (Performance)The game should run smoothly on midrange PCs with 1k/30+fps.

2. (Security)The game saves should be encrypted to prevent cheating/tampering.

3. (Usability)Controls should be intuitive and responsive, suitable for both novice and experienced players.

4. (Scalability): System should support various vehicle models with different handling characteristics. Modular vehicle control system to allow easy updates or additions of new mechanics.


## Data Requirements

1. on-time game statistics(e.g. car speed, time limit, car health, drift distance, etc.)

## Technical requirements

1. UMG(Unreal Motion Graphics UI Designer) for UI design.
